                <h3>Weather Prediction</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is an early-stage weather prediction web application
                     that utilizes PyTorch for machine learning-based forecasting. 
                     The goal is to provide accurate, data-driven weather predictions 
                     through a user-friendly web interface. While the frontend is currently 
                     hosted on GitHub Pages, the backend is under development and will 
                     be migrated to AWS for robust performance and scalability.

                <p>
                    The Interactive Fretboard project aims to create a dynamic and educational tool for guitar players of all levels. 
                    This web application will allow users to visualize scales, chords, and arpeggios on a virtual guitar fretboard. 
                    Currently, the project is in the development phase, focusing on building the functionality and user interface.
                    Future plans include adding features such as naming the chords the user selected using machine learning.

                <h3>Breast Cancer Prediction</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involves building a machine learning model to predict breast cancer using a Jupyter Notebook. 
                    The model is developed using the scikit-learn library and employs the Decision Tree algorithm for classification. 
                    The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. 
                    The goal is to accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on these features.
